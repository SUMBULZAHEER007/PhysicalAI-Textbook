# ROS 2: Robot Middleware

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is the middleware for building robot applications. It provides communication, hardware abstraction, and standard algorithms.

## ROS 2 Core Concepts

### Nodes

Nodes are independent processes performing specific tasks:
- Sensor drivers: Read camera, lidar, IMU data
- Controllers: Execute motion commands
- Perception algorithms: Object detection, SLAM
- Communication: HTTP API, database interfaces

Nodes communicate via topics, services, and actions.

### Topics (Publish-Subscribe)

Topics use asynchronous publish-subscribe pattern:
- Publisher sends messages continuously
- Subscribers receive all messages
- Many-to-many communication
- Good for continuous data streams

Common robot topics:
- /camera/image: RGB images
- /lidar/scan: Lidar point clouds
- /joint_states: Current joint angles
- /cmd_vel: Movement commands

### Services (Request-Response)

Services provide synchronous request-response communication:
- Client sends request and waits for response
- Server processes and sends reply
- One-to-one communication
- Good for on-demand operations

Example services:
- /gripper/open: Open the gripper
- /get_object_pose: Get detected object location
- /save_trajectory: Save learned trajectory

### Actions (Goal-Oriented)

Actions combine goals with feedback:
- Client sends goal
- Server provides feedback during execution
- Client can monitor progress or preempt
- Good for long-running tasks

Example actions:
- PickObject: Pick up and hold an object
- NavigateTo: Navigate robot to target location
- GraspObject: Plan and execute grasp

## ROS 2 Architecture

ROS 2 has multiple layers:
- Application Layer: Robot controllers and AI algorithms
- Middleware Layer: Communication, discovery, networking
- Hardware Layer: Sensors, actuators, real robot

## ROS 2 Package Structure

A typical ROS 2 package contains:
- package.xml: Package metadata and dependencies
- CMakeLists.txt: Build configuration
- src/: Source code files
- launch/: Launch configurations
- config/: Configuration files

## Useful ROS 2 Packages

- nav2: Navigation and path planning
- MoveIt!: Motion planning for manipulation
- OpenCV: Computer vision integration
- TensorFlow: Deep learning for perception
- gazebo_ros: Gazebo simulation integration

## ROS 2 Development Workflow

1. Create package with appropriate structure
2. Implement nodes that publish/subscribe to topics
3. Write launch files to start multiple nodes
4. Test in simulation first
5. Deploy to real hardware

## Advantages of ROS 2

1. Modularity: Separate concerns into independent nodes
2. Scalability: Easy to add new components
3. Reusability: Leverage existing packages
4. Standardization: Industry standard
5. Community: Large ecosystem and support

## Learning Resources

- Official ROS 2 documentation
- Tutorials and demos
- Open-source robot implementations

## Key Takeaways

- ROS 2 is essential middleware for modern robots
- Nodes communicate via topics, services, and actions
- Pub/sub pattern enables scalable distributed systems
- ROS 2 ecosystem provides many ready-to-use components
- Modularity makes large systems manageable
